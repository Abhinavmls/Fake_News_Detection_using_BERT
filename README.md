# Project Title: Fake News Detection Using BERT (Base-Uncased)

In this project, I built a deep learning system that can automatically classify news articles as real or fake, using BERT — one of the most powerful models in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The idea behind this project was to tackle the rising issue of fake news and misinformation, especially on social media platforms where false content spreads quickly and can have real-world consequences.

Why I Started This Project:
The internet is flooded with information — and unfortunately, a lot of it isn't true. Fake news can mislead people, influence public opinion, and even create panic. I wanted to create a solution that could help users, journalists, or platforms quickly check whether a news article is likely to be real or fake, using machine learning and NLP.

The Challenges I Faced:
Understanding the Full Meaning of Text
One of the biggest challenges was that traditional models (like Naive Bayes or SVM) don’t really "understand" text. They look at words individually, not in the full context of a sentence. For example, “The vaccine is not dangerous” and “The vaccine is dangerous” are very different — but without understanding context, some models treat them similarly.
Messy and Biased Data
The dataset I worked with had a lot of noise — such as clickbait titles, opinion-based articles, and poorly labeled examples. Cleaning the data without losing important meaning was tricky.
Imbalanced Dataset
There were more real articles than fake ones (or vice versa, depending on the dataset), which made training a fair model more complicated. It kept leaning towards the majority class.
Training a Big Model Like BERT
BERT is powerful but also heavy — it needs a good amount of computing power and careful tuning. Getting it to train well without overfitting was a learning curve.
What I Did:
I preprocessed the data by removing irrelevant parts but kept enough context so BERT could still make sense of the sentences.
I used BERT (base-uncased) because it understands words in context — unlike older models, it reads text like humans do, looking at both the left and right of each word to understand its meaning.
I fine-tuned the model using tools like Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch, and optimized training by adjusting learning rates and freezing some of the early layers.
I also used techniques to handle class imbalance, like resampling, so the model wouldn't just favor one class.
The Results:
The final model performed really well — achieving over 90% accuracy on test data. More importantly, it was able to catch subtle fake news articles that might look real at first glance. It clearly outperformed older models I tried earlier, like logistic regression or simple LSTMs.

What This Solves:
This system can help flag misleading news before it spreads too far. It could be integrated into a news aggregator, browser extension, or even used by journalists to quickly vet information. It doesn’t replace human judgment but acts as a first line of defense against misinformation.

Final Thoughts:
Working on this project taught me a lot — not just about BERT and NLP, but also about how important it is to design machine learning systems responsibly. Tackling fake news is a big challenge, but tools like this can make a real difference when used carefully. I’m proud of how this project turned out and excited about how it could be developed further in the future.
